        <h1>GitHub & Hack Club partnership renewal</h1>
    </center>

    <section>

        <p>In the last year, 12k+ high school students have engaged with Hack Club activities, either taking our tutorials,
            on our Slack or attending Hack Club hackathons. By our accounting, only 10 percent of high schoolers joining
            Hack Club knew about GitHub before joining.

            Over the six months, Hack Club has raised GitHubâ€™s profile in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>8,777 students have been funded via GitHub cash grants.</li>
            <li>2,000 new student club applications Hack Club started following GitHub's blog announcement</li>
            <li>1,964 students from Hack Club requesting Student Developer Packs</li>
            <li>3,000 GitHub stickers sent to high school students</li>
            <li>$25k Github grants dispersed to students with letter crediting GitHub</li>
            <li> For the 637 member of the Hack Club org, 51.96% contribute to MEU and 40.81% contribute to MAC. This is
                more than the general population of users and less that say Campus Experts or Advisors.</li>
            <li>Widespread awareness of GitHub raised across all Hack Club platforms. Since Zach and Mo launched our
                partnership last year, Hack Club enrollment/participation has grown a lot</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Summer of Making</h3>

        <p>This summer, GitHub and Hack Club launched a joint summer program that has reached thousands of students around
            the world</p>

        <p>See how students are using Summer of Making in Action here on our <a href="
            https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/r/github">Scrapbook Page</p></a>

        <ul>
            
            <li>50,000 words of project ideas for the GitHub grants have been submitted at the half way mark </li>
            <li>Hardware sent to 201 makers from 28 countries and 85 cities</li>
            <li>16 years old is the average age</li>
            <li>Nearly all SOM students opensourced their projects, with a gallery</li>
            <li>GitHub stickers/SOM are now going out to over 6,000 people</li>
            <li>From the GitHub newsletter, we had 13.5k clickthroughs, 5.5k sticker signups, & approx 500 new signups</li>
            <li>Hack Club students participating in GitHub's a SOM video</li>
        </ul>
        <P>Anticipated $13k remaining</P>

        <p>Hack Club is the destination social network for teenage hackers in the US and around the world. By our
            accounting, only 10 percent of high schoolers joining Hack Club knew about GitHub before joining. Other coding
            orgs for teenagers do not know/endorse/understand GitHub. Students who go on the journey towards coding use
            GitHub.</p>
